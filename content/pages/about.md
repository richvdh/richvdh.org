Title: About me, and this blog

Hi! My name is Richard van der Hoff, though I'm generally known on the internet
as `richvdh`.

I am a Staff Software Engineer at [Element](https://element.io/), where I work
on the [Matrix](https://matrix.org) ecosystem. My first proper software
development job was (way back in 2000) at a startup writing embedded automotive
software (i.e., engine management software). In the interim, I've had jobs
working in telecoms, content delivery networks, and even a stint working on
user interfaces for Windows software.

I'm starting this blog as a place to record some thoughts and experiences I've
collected after a few laps around the block as a software engineer. Hopefully
some of it will prove useful!
